## Description
This is a simple project that includes three screens: a registration screen, a login screen, and a chats screen. The goal is to create a basic user interface using HTML and CSS. Bootstrap 5 has been used for some of the UI elements to enhance the design.

## Screens
The project includes the following screens:

### Login Screen
The login screen is the main page of the web application. On this screen, the user is prompted to enter their username and password to log in. If the user does not have an account, there is a link to the registration screen. The design of the login screen is simple and clean, making it easy for users to quickly access the application.

### Registration Screen
The registration screen allows new users to sign up for the chat application. On this screen, users are asked to enter a username, password, display name, and picture. Additionally, there is a password verification field to ensure that the user enters the correct password. The design of the registration screen is similar to the login screen in terms of visibility.

### Chat Screen
The chat screen is divided into two parts. In the first part, a list of chats is displayed for each user the current user is talking with. The information displayed for each chat includes a photo of the user, their nickname, the last message sent, and the date/time it arrived. In the second part of the screen, the correspondence (that is, the messages) with the same recipient will be displayed. The design of the chat screen is intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the application. Additionally The chat screen includes a popup window to add a new recipient to the list of chats. When the user clicks on the "Add" button, a popup window appears, asking for the recipient's username.
